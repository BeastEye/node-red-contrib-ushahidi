# Node-Red Ushahidi Node

A node that can be used for posting information to Ushahidi. It does not support
any other ways to interact with Ushahidi as of right now. There might be more
nodes added in the future (getting posts, updating data, deleting posts).

In order for your posts to show up directly on the map you have to log on using
an admin account. This is how Ushahidi works and nothing we can do anything about.
You can also post using a regular account or without account but these won't
show up on the map until the admin approves them.
